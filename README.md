# Roborobo.4


**Roborobo** is a fast and simple 2D mobile robot simulator loosely based on low-cost mobile robots such as khepera or epuck models. It is targeted for fast single and multi-robots simulation for evolutionary robotics and machine learning in multi-agent systems, collective and swarm robotics.

**Roborobo** combines speed of development _and_ speed of execution. Roborobo can be programmed with python 3.x, with all the core functions written in C++ for super fast execution.

## Version

Roborobo version 4 is currently the __only__ supported version. Current official release is (from: *roborobo.cpp*):

# INSTALLATION

Roborobo basic dependencies are: 
* a C++ compiler (GCC or CLANG)
* Python 3.x

Supported platforms:
 * Linux-based
 * MacOS X

Linux and MacOS installation instructions are described below. Other platforms are not officially supported, but Roborobo was previously shown to run on: MS Windows, Raspbian and Pandora.

_Remark: if you get a lot of warnings during compilation, this is probably due to already installed pip packages shadowing the newly installed conda packages (e.g. with pybind). Work around for pyBind that may work: conda install -c conda-forge "pybind11>2.6". However the best way is to delete the pip packages and make a clean install of roborobo again__

# QUICK START

It is highly suggested to use the __python__ interface to Roborobo, which we refer to as __pyRoborobo__. If you prefer to develop your project in C++, it also possible (check below). pyRoborobo is built as an interface to Roborobo, and though there is of course a cost to use Python instead of pure C++, we empirically consider it worth the ease of development in the context of academic research. For example, the Boids example runs at ~400 fps (pure C++) and ~200 fps (pyRoborobo) on a Macbook pro 13 (early 2019 model).

Roborobo (C++) and pyRoborobo (Python) both uses three important directories, that should be accessible from where your code (C++ binary or python script) is run. 
* **_data_** contains image and resources for setting a roborobo environment
* **_config_** contains configuration files for running a roborobo environment 
* **_logs_** will contain log files generated during a roborobo run

While running an example, type "h" when the focus is on the Roborobo window. Help tips will be displayed in the console.

## Running a Python example

Activate conda environment (if not done already):
```bash
conda activate roborobo
```

Compile and install Roborobo (if not done already):
```bash
cd <your_roborobo_folder>
# python setup.py clean --all -- only if want to rebuild all from scratch
# deprecated: python setup.py install --force --user
python3 -m pip install . --force --user -v
```

Run a pyRoborobo example:

```bash
cd <your_roborobo_folder>/pyRoborobo_dev/examples/
python tutorial.py
```

Many other examples are available in the __pyRoborobo_dev/examples__ folder.

## Build the pyRoborobo API documentation (optional)

Build Roborobo's python API documentation:
```bash
# conda activate roborobo (if not already activated)
python setup.py build_sphinx
```

The pyRoborobo API documentation is now in _build/sphinx/html/index.html_


## Running a C++ example (optional)

If you installed Roborobo for the first time, setup the directory structure for running Roborobo: 

Setup the directory structure for both C++ and Python development (done only once):

```bash
# Roborobo C++ code
cd <your_roborobo_folder>/build
ln -s ../data
ln -s ../config
ln -s ../logs
```

Activate conda environment (if not done already):
```bash
conda activate roborobo
```

Compile and install Roborobo (to be done every time you modify the C++ code:
```bash
cd <your_roborobo_folder>
# python setup.py clean --all --user _only if want to rebuild all from scratch_
# deprecated: python setup.py install --force --user
python3 -m pip install . --force --user -v
```

Run a roborobo example:

```bash
cd <your_roborobo_folder>/build
./roborobo -l config/Tutorial.properties
```

Roborobo (C++) examples are in the <your_roborobo_folder>/prj directory. Note that project selection is achieved from the configuration file (config/filename.properties)

## Troubleshooting

Roborobo is regularly tested on the most recent Ubuntu LTS. While you should not encounter any problems with an up-to-date Linux distribution, it may be different with non-standard, outdated and/or badly managed Linux distributions. The following covers the most common errors. Note that before trying to fix things, you should be 100% sure that you followed _exactly_ the installation steps provided above.

 * First, be sure that conda uses the same Python version as the default one used in the terminal.
 	* To check which versions are used:
		* for Python in Conda: _conda list | grep python_
		* for Python in Terminal: _python3 --version_
	* To force conda to use a specific version of Python: _conda create (...) python==3.12_. Updating conda to the latest version if needed.
 	* To force that the _python_ or _python3_ alias points to the expected python version, re-define the alias in your profile file. E.g.: with _bash_, edit the .bashrc file and add the following line at the end: _alias python='/usr/bin/python3.xx'_ with _xx_ the preferred version. Restart the terminal after modification.
 * When executing _conda activate roborobo_
        * error: the shell (e.g. bash) is not configured.
	* solution 1: _conda init bash_. This may fail if your bash profile has been badly written. Fix: clean your bash profile
   	* solution 2: use another shell. E.g. _tcsh_. I.e. restart installation from scratch. In the terminal, type _tcsh_ before the command _conda activate roborobo_ (during installation, and afterwards when coding).
 * When executing _python3 -m pip install . --force --user -v_
	 * => error during execution "could NOT find SDL2" (hidden somewhere in the very long list of messages)
	 * system install of SDL2 (must be super user). See apt commands above.
 * When executing _python3 -m pip install . --force --user -v_
 	 * error referring to Sphinx (Sphinx is used for generating the documentation)
         * easy fix (recommended): remove reference to Sphinx in setup.py (delete line 7 and remove _'build_sphinx': BuildDoc_ from line 64)
         * easy fix (not recommended): switch to a different version of Python (e.g. away from 3.10) 
 * When executing _python3 -m pip install . --force --user -v_
	 * error: problem with missing MESA/GLX (this is related to the OpenGL graphic library and its open-source implementation in Linux systems).
	 * solution (see above): apt-get install -y mesa-utils libgl1-mesa-glx
 * When executing _python setup.py install --force --use -v_
	 * error: "setup.py install is deprecated." (this should not happen if you follow the tutorial)
	 * You tried to run setup.py. Contrary to what the message says, setup.py isn't deprecated but can no longer be used directly.
	 * Solution (see above): python3 -m pip install . --force --user -v
	 * Comment: it can be pretty long. Be sure to use the -v option for verbose mode.
 * When executing _python setup.py install --force --use -v_
	 * error: "func.h:55:58: error: expected template-name before '<' token" or "Deprecated function in roborobo4/include/contrib/zsu/func.h, line 55"
	 * cause: recent compiler may spot a deprecated function in roborobo4/include/contrib/zsu/func.h, line 55
  	 * solution: roborobo4/include/contrib/zsu/func.h, line 55, replace:
		* new: class unary_function_binder: public std::unary_function<_Result, _Arg>
		* old: class unary_function_binder: public std::__unary_function<_Result, _Arg>
 * When executing _python3 tutorial.py_ (or any other examples)
	 * error: "no module name 'pyRoborobo'"
  	 * first, be sure to check that you followed every step of the installation tutorial. If this is the case, then try the following.
  	 * Solution 1: be sure that you have activated the conda environment (prefix of prompt should read something like _(roborobo)_)
   	 * Solution 2: this may be a tricky problem of mismatch Python versions from Conda and command-line. Use same python versions (i.e.: update Conda, or use specific Python version in command line). Comment: Conda's Python and default Python command uses different versions. Check with _conda list | grep python_ and _python --version_. They should be the same.
 * When executing _python tutorial.py_ (or any other examples)
	 * error looks like: ImportError: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwayland-client.so.0: undefined symbol: ffi_type_uint32, version LIBFFI_BASE_7.0
	 * fix looks like: solution: export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.7
 * As of early 2024, Mac M2 does not seem to be able to run Roborobo. You may use Virtualbox to install a Linux OS but this is still in beta for Mac M1/M2 as of early 2024. Check dedicated [topic on virtualbox forum](https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=107344) for updates on the topic. Alternatively, you can use Parallels Desktop (but it is not free).
